# Data Structures

This Data Structures Library was done in the context of the Data Structures subject of the Informatics Engineering
Degree.

It contains multiple Abstract Data Types such as the List, Stack, Graph, Heap, Binary (Search) Tree, Queue and Network,
and most of their respective implementations (Linked List, Array List, AVL Tree, Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix
Graphs/Networks), among others. All Data Structures are thoroughly tested with multiple JUnit tests, and the
building/testing process is automated with Gradle.

To build this project, and its respective JAR to be used as a library for another Java application, run `gradle build`,
and for testing `gradle test`. This library needs a Java version greater or equal than 14.
